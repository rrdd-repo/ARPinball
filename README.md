# ARPinball
An AR experiment with Unity's Vuforia plugin.

Project doesn't have a build because this was a showcase to my class.

The idea is that you hold a hiro marker image just like the one in Assets, and then you can rotate it around to move the level. By pressing spacebar you can make the ball player character inside the level jump.

The objective is to get every golden ball in the level.
